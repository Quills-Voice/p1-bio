			<h1>Quill's Voice</h1>		
			<p>I am an aspiring author who has been writing fiction as a hobby for about five years. This past year, I have set my discipline to prepare for publishing. I favor darker themes and anything with a historic twist. I am also a budding blogger and website designer who is currently pursuing a degree in Technical Communications. 
			<p>Currently, my stories will are free to read and hosted my blog <i>The Indie Horror Show.</i> "The Eye of The Storm" and "Steam to Ashes" are two to watch for. I also host a site for interactive writing featuring in-character performances from talented writers called <i>The Eclipsed Quill</i>.
			<p>I do have a few works for publishing in progress. My first novel, <i>The Black Butterfly</i> will be ready for submission by the end of 2015. I am also working on a co-authored piece entitled <i>Rosenrot Asylum.</i>
			<p>I am interested in networking with other dark-themed writers and hunting for literary agents who are looking for submissions in the horror genre. Feel free to get in touch!
